Question #12: What is the difference between Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum Content?
Answer #12: Tiles are branded as Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum to differentiate content based on different quality standards. As you level-up, so does the quality of the content. **NOTE:** Bronze, Silver, and Gold allocations are part of the crowdsourcing model and can be allocated by the contributor with the below standards as guidance. Platinum content is currently only provided by Bob Kalka’s Product Squads and Eddie Daghelian’s Activation Kit teams. **_We are opening up the ability for crowdsourced content to become Platinum in September._**

**Bronze** - Buyer Beware (may not be current and/or supported), grouped resources facilitating experiential activity, may be IBMer only

**Silver** - Buyer Beware (shared ‘as is’ without any testing or vetting), author supported (best effort to respond), use case driven, may have a reservable environment, may have a defined journey, should be Business Partner accessible

**Gold** - Author or community supported (24 hours to acknowledge), guided demo script, FAQ and/or troubleshooting guide, reservable environment, defined journey, community reviewed & tested, must be Business Partner accessible

**Platinum** - Community supported via Slack (same day acknowledgement), lead-with or growth offering, IBM Cloud reservable environment, utilizes most recent version release, technical review & sign off by a product squad member, reviewed & updated every 30 days, approved by Technical Sales brand executive

If they want only specific people to be able to access their collection, they can add them as collaborators to the collection.

Question #155: Why are no reservation metrics displaying after selecting the ‘Reservations’ option?
Answer #155: Answer: Reservation metrics are captured from environments that are catalogued on a collection and the provisioning pipeline has to be one that IBM Technology Zone team currently supports. If you have an environment catalogued on your collection that is of infrastructure type: Systems Redirect, or Hosted Redirect then please note that these environment options are merely a redirect to another site where then the reservation is to be provisioned from. As we consolidate additional environments from CECC, ISCEP, SCS and more these metrics will start to display on your collections once they are reserved directly from an IBM Technology Zone collection.

Here are the steps to check:

1.  Select the collection edit button
2.  Scroll down to the Environments section
3.  Select an Environment to see the ‘Infrastructure’ field.

*   If you have an environment catalogued as one of the infrastructure redirect types and would like to know when the environment is planned to be migrated, please contact [brooke.jones@ibm.com](mailto:brooke.jones@ibm.com). We are currently working with CECC, ISCEP, SCS and SBaaS portals to consolidate environments to IBM Technology Zone.
