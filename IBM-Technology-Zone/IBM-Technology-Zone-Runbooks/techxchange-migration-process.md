<h1 align="center">Requesting TechXchange Lab Migrations to TechZone</h1>

You own an environment that was used at a TechXchange event and you would like to have migrated so others can make a reservation directly on TechZone. 

## Before you start

Before you migrate your labs from TechXchange to TechZone, you should be aware of both the initial
and the ongoing expectations for TechZone content. To continue to have up-to-date and relevant 
content in TechZone, you should be aware of TechZone's content lifecycle.

To learn more about the content lifecycle for TechZone, see the questions below in the FAQ:

1. [Is there a lifecycle for content in TechZone?](/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-FAQs/content-faqs.md#is-there-a-lifecycle-for-content-in-techzone)
1. [What are the expectations for author support in TechZone?](/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-FAQs/content-faqs.md#what-are-the-expectations-for-author-support-in-techzone)

It is important to understand--before migrating your content to TechZone--that publishing your
content in TechZone comes with an obligation to support the content and keep it updated as long
as it's published in TechZone.


## Getting Started

### 1. Before migrating an Environment you must first have a TechZone Collection.

_**Note:** If you don't have a Collection on TechZone, please view the instructions below:_

1. To create your own collection, visit the [How to Create a Collection Runbook](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/techzone-content.md#how-to-create-a-collection) for more information.

2.  Add **Resources**, view the [How to Create a Resource](https://github.ibm.com/dte-support/private/blob/master/itz/itz-runbooks/techzone-content.md#:~:text=Back%20to%20Top-,What%20is%20a%20Resource,-%3F) for more information on house to create the resource. Create a resource explaining the lab guide and implement it as a Resource Document type.

     
### 2. Raise a TechZone support ticket to request your Lab be Migrated to TechZone

1. Reach out to TechZone support team by [opening a case](https://ibmsf.force.com/ibminternalproducts/s/createrecord/NewCase?language=en_US) or by emailing [techzone.help@ibm.com](techzone.help@ibm.com) to request your lab to be migrated to TechZone. 

2. Provide the following details in your request:

    -  The Collection name and direct URL link to the collection.
 
    -  The Session ID.


>  _**DISCLAIMER:** Please be aware of the following steps that are taken before the template transfer can proceed:_
> 
>  _- ISOs associated with the source template will be unmounted._
> 
> _-  Snapshots associated with the source template will be deleted._
> 
> _The Aspera automation that performs the template transfer tends to fail unless the above steps are taken._
> _If this process is disruptive to your template, please communicate with Support so we can determine other available options._

### 3. User Validation Testing

Once environment has been added, lab authors should test to ensure everything is working as required.
