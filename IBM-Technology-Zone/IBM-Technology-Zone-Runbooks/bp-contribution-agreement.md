   **Content Contributor Guidelines & Accountability** 

IBM Technology Zone is a crowdsourced content portal for our go-to-market teams and partner ecosystem. In order to build the site with best-of-breed content, all [Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum](https://ibm.box.com/v/branding-standards) Contributors must adhere to the following standards to ensure content quality, accessibility and currency, which will keep the site viable.

NOTE: As you level up, your collections must incorporate the standards from the previous level, plus the new standards for the next level.

   **Content Maintenance Standards**
   
   1. Content Currency - Silver and Bronze contributors must perform the following maintenance reviews every quarter, Gold every 60 days, and Platinum every 30 days in order to meet site standards.
   2. Content Accuracy - changing anything that is no longer factually accurate since publication or disabling if no longer viable
   3. Technical Accuracy – updating the content when a new product version has been released that impacts the viability and currency of the content
   4. Accessibility - links are routed to the correct content and are accessible to both IBMers and BPs (where applicable)`
