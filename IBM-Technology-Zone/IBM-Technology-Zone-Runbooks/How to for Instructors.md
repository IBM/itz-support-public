## How to for Instructors

Once an instrutor submits a Workshop schedule it is reviewed within 72 hours from when it is submitted. 

If your request is not reviewed send a note to #itz-workshop-support

1. When an instructor submits a schedule it is automatically placed in "pending approval" within 72 hours your request will either be denied or approved based on available resources, a notification is also sent to the #itz-worskhop-support channel.
2. Notifications are sent in slack #itz-worskhop-support channel for when your workshop is "pending approval", "rejected" or "approved", "ready/active"
3. You can view the status of your request directly from [My Workshop page](https://techzone.ibm.com/my/workshops) or using the instructors urls (Manage this workshop request) sent in the confirmation/scheduled email.
4. Instructors receive an email containing workshop details 24 hours before the schedule start date and time.
