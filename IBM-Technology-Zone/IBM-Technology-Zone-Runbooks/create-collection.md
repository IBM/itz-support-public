In this runbook we will walk through the required fields to submit a simple collection quickly on IBM Technology Zone!

1. Select the 'Share your content' button right from the home page.

![Share your content button](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/share%20your%20content%20button.png)

2. Please read and agree to the "Content Contributor Guidelines"
This will inform you of each content owner badge service level agreement that you must agree to before contributing to IBM Technology Zone. 

![content guideliens agreement modal](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/Agree%20to%20the%20content%20contributor%20guidelines.png)

3. **Title of collection:** Provide an intuitive title for this collection and see example displayed in the field.  

![collection title](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/title%20of%20your%20collection.png)

4. **Custom URL field:** This field will populate automatically based on the title of the collection you provided in the previous step. Feel free to change and create a custom URL as you deem fit as the content owner. 

![custom url field](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/Custom%20URL%20field.png)

Here is an example of a custom url on the site today:

* Custom URL field example: custom-roks-vm-ware-requests 
* Resulted in collection URL being: https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/custom-roks-vm-ware-requests 

5. **Short business value statement:** Provide one sentence that showcases the value of this collection to the end user when searching for this content.

See two examples of how this field will display from the search page: 

Example one: Grid view (Otherwise known as tile view)

![Search example one](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/search%20vusiness%20value%20statement%20example%201.png)

Example two: Table view (otherwise known as list view)

![search example 2](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/search%20business%20value%20statement%20example%202.png)

6. **IBM Products field:** Start typing in the product name that this collection is related to. A drop-down list will display once you are finished typing with results to choose from. Select the best product match from the list. 

![IBM Products field](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/IBM%20products%20field.png)

* In this example, I searched Cloud Pak for Data. Scroll through the results and choose the best match product based on the IBM product/solution that this collection intends to show the end user.

* For more information on how we pull our list of IBM Products, reference the [Product Taxonomy run book](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/product-taxonomy.md)

7. **Brand field:** This field is required but if you follow the previous step, this field will automatically populate based on the Product that you input in the IBM Product field.

8. **Visibility field:** This field will allow you to select which users can view this collection. 

* Selecting IBMers, means that IBMers when logged in will be able to view this collection.
* Selecting Business Partners, means that Business Partners when logged in will be able to view this collection. 
* Selecting IBMers & Business Partners, means this collection will be visible to both to view this collection.

Select the appropriate visibility level based on the intent for this collection.

9. Now, lets leave this collection in a status of draft and proceed to **Save** this collection as you have it! 

![Save the collection](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/save%20the%20collection.png)

* Wait for the Collection saved notification to display before continueing.
